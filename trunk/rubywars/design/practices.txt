This is a list of some "best practices" that I (jcroisant) think
should be kept in mind over the course of this project.

- Have modest goals. Once those are achieved, create further goals.
- At the end of every day, the game should be playable in some form.
- Each part controls its own interface -- outside code does not
  impose a specific structure on it. Of course, you can ask nicely
  for it to be changed...

Add others as you see fit.
